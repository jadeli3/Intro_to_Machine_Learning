Intro to machine learning final project 
Since trainX.pt, trainY.pt, testX.pt are to large too upload on Github
In order to run the uploaddate.ipynb lease upload trainX.pt, trainY.pt, testX.pt in the same directory as uploaddate.ipynb and final_project.ipynb
When a file called lazydata appears, then please run the final_project.ipynb
At least, the submission file would appear
